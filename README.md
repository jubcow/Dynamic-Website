# Dynamic-Website
Uses PHP, mySQL, HTML+CSS to create a site for users to create accounts with which they can submit, and view pasta recipes. Was written by Joshua Butler, Matthew Hillmer, Amos Dufore, and Will Jones (UMW Compsci undergrads). We used a private git repository so I am creating this one to be visible.
